# eth2-deposit-contract

This is a just for fun port of the [Vyper Eth 2.0 deposit contract](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/blob/dev/deposit_contract/contracts/validator_registration.vy) to Solidity.

The motivation is to run the SMTChecker and the new Yul IR generator option (`--ir`) in the compiler.

**THIS IS NOT THE OFFICIAL DEPOSIT CONTRACT. NOT SUITABLE FOR ANY USE**
